Metlhedd:
My game is called Metlhedd. It is inspired by a black mirror episode that used it as a prop for a fictional video game company called Tuckersoft. 

You can run it by placing the metlhedd file (it's simple a file, no extension) into the root
folder of the kernel. You will also need to place all the PNGs alongside it. 

Once that is complete, you can run ./metlhedd -qws and it will appear in VNC-viewer. Gameplay is fairly simple. There is a menu at first, you can get past it by pressing spacebar. An instruction screen will appear for a short duration.

The controls are as follows:
(based on arrow keys)
Press DOWN to dodge the drone
Press UP to jump over the trap
Press RIGHT to shoot the robot (the "metl hedds")

Your character will infinitely run until defeated. Failure to deal with a threat will cost you one health point. Lose all three and it will be game over. 

To restart the game, you must close it (ctrl+c) and rerun it with ./metlhedd -qws.
